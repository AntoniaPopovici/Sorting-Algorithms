# Data Structures Project - Sorting Algorithms
<p>
The code compares the complexity of five sorting algorithms: Counting Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Shell Sort and Radix Sort. The PowerPoint contains details about these.
</p>
<p> If the output of the program is 1, the numbers generated are sorted correct. Otherwise, they are not.

<p> Numbers N = 1000000 and Max = 10000000 weren't tested for Counting Sort and Insertion Sort, since they are inefficient. In the PowerPoint, 9th slide, there is a printscreen with the running time for both of them.
